# L1 Skill: General Coding

## When to use

Default for application tasks when no narrower domain skill dominates.

## Workflow

1. Confirm scope and non-scope from TaskSpec.
2. Make smallest viable code changes.
3. Validate with deterministic commands.
4. Summarize diff against acceptance criteria.

## Quality Gates

- No unrelated file edits.
- No hidden side effects.
- Add or update tests for behavioral changes.
- Keep docs in sync if behavior changes.
