# L1 Skill: Frontend UI

## When to use

Use for UI component, page interaction, accessibility, and browser behavior tasks.

## Workflow

1. Lock component boundaries and states from TaskSpec.
2. Implement UI changes with deterministic styling scope.
3. Validate behavior on desktop and mobile.
4. Run lint/tests and capture visual proof when needed.

## Quality Gates

- Accessibility basics covered (labels, focus, semantics).
- No global style regressions.
- Responsive behavior confirmed.
- Interaction states are explicit.
