# L1 Skill: Backend API

## When to use

Use for backend routes, services, API contracts, validation, and persistence logic.

## Workflow

1. Freeze API contract from TaskSpec.
2. Implement minimal endpoint/service changes.
3. Update schema, validation, and tests.
4. Run unit/integration checks.

## Quality Gates

- Backward compatibility is explicit.
- Input validation is strict and test covered.
- Error behavior is deterministic.
- Migrations (if any) are reversible.
